# MCP integration assessment and plan

## Recommendation

MCP integration is optional and should not be required for the country-profiling prototype.

The Country Profiling skill can produce useful healthcare profiles from plain documents, public web sources, and open WHO data APIs. MCP becomes valuable later if the project needs structured access to SMART/FHIR artifacts or terminology services after the country profile has established the broader context.

## Why MCP may be useful later

Country profiling itself is primarily public-health and health-system synthesis. Later policy comparison or localization may need to connect that context to SMART Implementation Guides, FHIR packages, terminology services, ValueSet expansion, CodeSystem lookup, or ImplementationGuide context.

Potential MCP-supported downstream tasks:

- inspect ImplementationGuide metadata;
- list available PlanDefinition, ActivityDefinition, ValueSet, CodeSystem, Questionnaire, and StructureMap resources;
- expand ValueSets relevant to a later policy-comparison task;
- look up code meanings;
- identify terminology bindings that may need country adaptation;
- flag unresolved terminology or workflow dependencies for human review.

## Proposed implementation phases

### Phase 1: No MCP dependency

- Keep the profile skill model-neutral.
- Use provided documents, WHO pages, and the GHO OData helper script.
- Store MCP requirements as documentation only.

### Phase 2: MCP discovery spike

- Evaluate candidate SMART/FHIR MCP tooling in a disposable environment.
- List available tools and resources.
- Test read-only operations against one public SMART Implementation Guide.
- Document required configuration, authentication, and data inputs.

### Phase 3: Downstream integration

- Add MCP usage notes to policy comparison or terminology mapping skills, not to the core country profile path.
- Keep all outputs traceable to artifact IDs and versions.
- Keep MCP-derived facts separate from human-authored country policy documents and public-health country profile evidence.

## Safety rules

- Use MCP read-only at first.
- Do not treat FHIR terminology matches as policy decisions.
- Record artifact version, package URL, retrieval date, and tool output.
- Keep MCP-derived facts separate from country healthcare conditions and national policy claims.
