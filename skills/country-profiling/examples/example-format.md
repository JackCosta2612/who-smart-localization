# Example format

Use this file as the format for a future example. Do not treat it as a completed example.

Placeholder only. Add real WHO and country-specific sources before using this as an evaluation example.

## Example input format

```md
# Country profile request

## Country

<Country>

## Optional downstream focus

<None/general overview, or a downstream health area such as immunization when preparing later policy comparison>

## Intended downstream use

<Policy comparison, SMART Guidelines localization, DAK preparation, or general context only>

## Supplied source material

| Source | Source type | Publisher | Date | URL or file path | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <source title> | <source class> | <publisher> | <date> | <direct PDF, dataset, official full-text/attachment URL, or local file path> | <why it matters; note if only a landing page is available> |

## Retrieval note

<If no documents are supplied, use deterministic script-assisted retrieval where
available. If scripts are unavailable but web access exists, use controlled
web-assisted retrieval.>

## Known limitations

- <missing source class, stale document, language limitation, or scope limitation>
```

## Example output format

```md
